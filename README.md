â€¢	Skin diseases like melanoma are traditionally screened by a visual analysis of key features, such as the pigmentation and vascularity of the region of interest. Monitoring the changes of these features during follow-up imaging sessions is critical towards a correct medical diagnosis. This project proposes a framework to monitor these changes on the skin over time. The proposed framework utilizes the automated data collection from skin displacement flow implementation to detect the severity of spatial changes in the skin. These spatial changes are captured via the magnitude and direction of the vectors in the resultant displacement field. This change monitoring is tested for surface and sub-surface skin image data  and color view analysis. if any changes in skin detected  means solution recommended medicine can be sent to medical shop . The patient do not even need to visit the stores once they can access the home where the druggists upload their drug lists data to server. Smart phones are becoming cheaper and are most popular around the globe. Thus this environment friendly 'pen-paperless' Android based application can be an efficient solution to save the druggists' and patient' time by reducing the extra time for drug requisition. The solution has been designed, implemented and testing to show the effectiveness of the solution
